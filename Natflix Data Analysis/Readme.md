<h2>Netflix Content Analysis Dashboard</h2>

Netflix is one of the leading video streaming platforms worldwide, offering a diverse range of movies and TV shows across various genres and regions. To analyze its content library, I created this Tableau dashboard, which captures essential insights and trends.

<b>Key Features and Insights of My Work:</b>

- Global Content Distribution: The world map shows the distribution of Netflix movies and TV shows across countries, highlighting where content is most concentrated. 
- Movies vs. TV Shows: A pie chart reveals that movies make up the majority of Netflix's catalog (68.42%), compared to TV shows (31.58%).
- Yearly Content Trends: The area chart visualizes how Netflix's library has grown over time, separating movies and TV shows for better clarity.
- Ratings Breakdown: The bar chart gives an overview of content ratings, with TV-MA and TV-14 being the most common categories.
- Top Genres: The genre analysis highlights the most popular categories, with documentaries and stand-up comedies topping the list.
- Detailed Content Exploration: Interactive filters allow users to explore specific titles, like "Stranger Things," and view detailed information such as genre, 
  description, duration, and release year.
   
This dashboard leverages Tableau's dynamic capabilities to make the data engaging and insightful, providing a clear understanding of Netflixâ€™s content trends and global reach.
